Screenshots credit to Madhouse.</figcaption></p><p>Claymore is great. Adapted from a dark fantasy manga authored by Norihiro Yagi, the show follows the story of Clare, one of the Claymores – a group of semi-human female warriors employed to protect humanity from youma (demons). It has superb characterization and a gripping plot. It has blood-pumping action balanced with tender, heartfelt moments. Though it aired in 2007, it’s art style and animation still hold up relatively well. Yogi’s work also presents one of the best portrayals of strong female characters in anime. In a medium where female characters are primarily designed to be visually pleasing to viewers, Claymore stands out. That’s not all. Perhaps most importantly, Claymore reveals a keen perspective on human nature and justice – one when viewed with a Christian lens offers insight into who we are and who God is.</p><p>For the most part, humanity in Claymore sucks. From the very first episode, humans are characterized by fear. When Claymore protagonist Clare enters a village to slay the youma plaguing them, the villagers are terrified. Instead of receiving her warmly, they hide: running into their homes, locking the doors, and shutting the windows. Their fear is not without substance, as Clare is half-demon herself (the demon half providing her with the necessary strength to fight the youma). Even so, none of the villagers, except for one boy, Raki, show her even a fraction of respect and honor for coming to slay the demon responsible for the murders of numerous villagers. While in hiding, they talk behind Clare’s back, saying that she “would kill them just as the demon did”. The village’s inhabitants make no effort to understand and receive her, preferring instead to dwell in their own presuppositions.</p><p>In addition to being fearful, these villagers are cowardly criminals. They would commit murder out of mere suspicion. As Clare fights and kills the youma, it is revealed that the demon had been masquerading as Raki’s older brother. When the villagers find out, they immediately take Raki by force and throw him off a cliff. All, even the village chief, are willing, even eager, to murder an innocent boy because of their fear.</p><p>It is not just those in Raki’s village that are morally corrupt. The inhabitants of most towns all behave in a similar way. As the story proceeds, Teresa, once strongest of the Claymores, is introduced in a flashback to Clare’s human past. In saving many towns from the youma, Teresa witnesses the same terror and cowardice in all of them. Even worse are the bandits who delight in evil. Taking advantage of the rule that Claymores are forbidden to kill humans, they attempt to loot and rape Teresa and Clare (They don’t succeed). One even goes as far as to drool uncontrollably while stalking Teresa, saying that he would “humiliate her until the point where she can’t stand it”. As Teresa remarks, it is hard to see that humans are worth fighting for. It is worth noting that not all humans are portrayed thus. Raki, pre-Claymore Clare, and the inhabitants of the holy city Rabona all show respect, honor, and love. However, they are the exception, not the norm.</p><p float="center"> <img src="/assets/img/claymore/claymore2.png" alt="drawing" width="100%" class="center" /><figcaption align="center">Teresa and young Clare.</figcaption></p><p>Claymore’s criticism of humanity is quite accurate. The same human corruption unfortunately abounds in the real world. Fear of the Covid-19 pandemic has unearthed hate, driving a huge spike in anti-Asian crimes. San Francisco police have reported an astonishing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/26/anti-asian-hate-crime-san-francisco-covid/">567% increase in violence against Asian Americans</a> for the year 2021. Recently, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/us/michelle-alyssa-go-life-family/index.html">Michelle Go</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/13/nyregion/murder-chinatown-nyc.html">Christina Lee</a> were brutally murdered in New York within the span of a month. It seems like school shootings happen so often that the general public has become desensitized to them. Worldwide, oppressive governments commit atrocities against their citizens.</p><p>Humanity’s failure to do what is good, righteous, and just validates the Christian view of human nature – that it is broken. Scripture describes humanity as fallen ever since Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit. As the Psalmist says, “all have become corrupt; there is no one good, not even one” (Psalm 14:3). The prophet Isaiah adds that humanity is quick to “run to evil”, “shed innocent blood”, and think “thoughts of iniquity” (Isaiah 59:7). The Apostle Paul summarizes in his letter to the Romans that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Human corruption, both in Claymore and the real world, reveals to us a glimpse of our sinful nature.</p><p>Claymore also presents a stunning portrayal of justice. As defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, justice is the “assignment of deserved reward or punishment; the giving of due deserts”. One particular scene in episode 6 exemplifies this. In the flashback detailing Clare’s human backstory, the bandits who had attempted to assault her and Teresa sack the town where she is staying. They set the town ablaze, slaughter the men, and take the women captive. Upon finding Clare, they make a show of tying her up and beating her, saying she’ll be made into a “good girl”. In the midst of the commotion, Teresa arrives, dressed in shining armor, Claymore in hand. Against a backdrop of flame, she eyes the bandits with ice-cold anger, striking fear into their hearts as they cower before her. Without pity nor hesitation, she gracefully strikes every last one of them dead, saving her companion Clare. Teresa delivers justice: giving the thieving, adulterous murderous what they deserve – death.</p><p float="center"> <img src="/assets/img/claymore/claymore3.png" alt="drawing" width="100%" class="center" /><figcaption align="center">Teresa and the bandits' fear.</figcaption></p><p>Similarly, death is also what each and every one of us deserve. The Apostle Paul writes in Romans 6:23 that “the wages of sin is death” – both physical and spiritual. All of humanity stands guilty before God on account of having broken his righteous law, as summarized in the Ten Commandments. How many have never lied, stolen, nor looked at someone with lust? How may have loved the Lord with heart, soul, mind, and strength? No one. To God, we are just as repulsive, if not more repulsive, than the bandits were to Teresa (and the viewer). It would have been right and just for God to do as Teresa did to the bandits – to wipe us forever out of existence.</p><p>Yet, God did not. He chose to send his righteous Son Jesus, fully man and fully God, to pay the penalty on our behalf. At the cross, Jesus took upon himself the punishment for our sins, bearing the wrath of God upon humanity and dying the death that we deserved. In doing so, He granted forgiveness of sins, eternal life, and inheritance of His kingdom for those who turn away from their sins and put their faith in Him. On the third day, he rose from the grave, defeating sin and death once and for all. God chose to enact justice by bearing our penalty himself. There is truly no greater love.</p><p>Claymore is more than just an enjoyable and unique show. It’s presentation of humanity provides a glimpse of our broken nature; it’s depiction of justice points towards God’s plan of restoration and salvation for humanity. In a world of increasing uncertainty and turmoil, we can rejoice, knowing that Christ has already won the victory over sin and Satan. We can take comfort, knowing that He will come again to make all things new.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2022-02-20T00:00:00-08:00">February 20, 2022</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/anime">anime</a>, <a href="/tag/jesus">jesus</a></span></section><script> var refTagger = { settings: { bibleVersion: 'ESV' } }; (function(d, t) { var n=d.querySelector('[nonce]'); refTagger.settings.nonce = n && (n.nonce||n.getAttribute('nonce')); var g = d.createElement(t), s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0]; g.src = 'https://api.reftagger.com/v2/RefTagger.js'; g.nonce = refTagger.settings.nonce; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s); }(document, 'script')); </script></main></body></html>
