   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to version 2.0 of my blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2017, during my first co-op term, I completed my first coding side project: a personal blog and website built using Jekyll and Ruby. This came after I was first introduced to programming by a few of my friends during my first year of undergrad at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p float=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshots from version 1.0 of my website&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it was a big achievement. From knowing pretty much nothing about coding as I entered university, I learned to master the command line, install packages, manage repositories through Git, and write Ruby code. I remember feeling proud, and I hoped it would be the start of many more projects to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, throughout the rest of my undergraduate in which I studied Civil Engineering, I was more or less always busy. Lectures often lasted from 8:30am to 5pm, five days a week. I spent my remaining time finishing projects and coursework, leading programs at the Chinese Christian Fellowship, and playing intramural sports. I had little time left for coding and side projects. Eventually, I even stopped updating my website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the back of my mind, though, I knew always wanted to move towards the software and technology sector. I enjoyed learning new algorithms and writing code. Through coding, I possessed the power to change the world at my fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am launching version 2.0 of my blog to document my personal journey post-graduation. I am hoping to break in to the software industry, preferably working on data science and artificial intelligence. It may be a long and hard road, but I am eager to begin the next chapter of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
