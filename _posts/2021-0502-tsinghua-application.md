If you are planning on applying to Tsinghua for graduate school as an international student, please make sure to submit your application well before the posted deadline. This is because there is an additional step in the application process post-submittal: Tsinghua must verify your application prior to the deadline.

I learned this the hard way.

For the past few weeks, I have been working night and day to prepare my graduate school application for a data science master's program at Tsinghua. The third and last round of applications were due 5pm, April 30th, Beijing time. Believing that I had up until the deadline to submit, I worked on perfecting my personal statement until the second last day. Once I was completely satisfied with my writing, I submitted my application. It was 5am, April 30th, Beijing time: 12 hours before the applications were due. I thought I had plenty of time to spare. However, upon submittal, I was met with a sudden message.

Without verification, the application fee could not be paid. Without paying the application fee, my application would not be considered. I was surprised. In the official application guide for international students, there was no mention of a required verification before the fee payment. I had no choice but to wait. For 12 hours, I waited patiently, checking the application website periodically for an answer. However, none came. Partway through, I emailed and called the admissions committee but received no answer. Eventually, the application deadline passed, and my application had not received verification. I was no longer under consideration for my program of choice.

Needless to say I was quite devastated. This was my last shot in getting into graduate school for the September 2021 intake, having not been successful with my prior applications. I also really wanted to study and experience life in China: to immerse myself in my cultural roots and see with my own eyes a society that in many ways has surpassed the western world in technology, infrastructure, and efficiency. To prepare for my application, I had entirely re-written my personal statement, paid for official documents from my university, and requested additional professors to write recommendation letters. I really believed I had put together a very strong package. 

In the end, it feels like all my effort was for naught. To not even have my application reviewed for admission even though I submitted 12 hours in advance of the deadline sucks. It would have been easier to accept if they had reviewed my documents and officially rejected me. 

It remains to be seen whether there is a silver lining to this story. Perhaps, it has taught me to stay strong and pick myself up after intense disappointment. Perhaps, parts of my personal statement might be used as a cover letter to land a future job. Perhaps there even remains a chance that Tsinghua will consider my application once I discuss the situation with them. Regardless, I can't help but feel that this situation should not have happened--that it isn't right.

To future Tsinghua applicants: Please submit your applications EARLY and get them verified, so that you won't have to experience the same disappointment as I did.

To Tsinghua Admissions Committee: Please make it clear that submitted applications require time for verification, or change the system such that applications that are submitted before the deadline are considered.
