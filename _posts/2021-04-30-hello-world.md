Welcome to version 2.0 of my blog!

In the summer of 2017, during my first co-op term, I completed my first coding side project: a personal blog and website built using Jekyll and Ruby. This came after I was first introduced to programming by a few of my friends during my first year of undergrad at the University of Waterloo.

For me, it was a big achievement. From knowing pretty much nothing about coding as I entered university, I learned to master the command line, install packages, manage repositories through Git, and write Ruby code. I remember feeling proud, and I hoped it would be the start of many more projects to come.

However, throughout the rest of my undergraduate in which I studied Civil Engineering, I was more or less always busy. Lectures often lasted from 8:30am to 5pm, five days a week. I spent my remaining time finishing projects and coursework, leading programs at the Chinese Christian Fellowship, and playing intramural sports. I had little time left for coding and side projects. Eventually, I even stopped updating my website.

In the back of my mind, though, I knew always wanted to move towards the software and technology sector. I enjoyed learning new algorithms and writing code. Through coding, I possessed the power to change the world at my fingertips.

I am launching version 2.0 of my blog to document my personal journey post-graduation. I am hoping to break in to the software industry, preferably working on data science and artificial intelligence. It may be a long and hard road, but I am eager to begin the next chapter of my life.
