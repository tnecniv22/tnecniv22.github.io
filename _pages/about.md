你好! I'm Vincent, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. 

When I was in elementary school, Facebook was still a novelty and the iPhone wasn't invented yet. In my free time, I played outside with my friends and read books. Much has changed since then. Many of my peers have stopped reading and writing, instead spending hours watching Netflix or scrolling through TikTok. I have also been guilty of this, and I have found myself lazier now than I ever was during my childhood years.

I'm trying to make an effort to read again. To write again. To create instead of consume. I'm hoping that this website will be a little creative outlet for me.
